# Neuroevolution: Optimize your NN using GA

Neuroevolution is a technique of generating and optimize Neural Networks using Evolutionary Algorithms and it usually used for Reinforcement Learning paradigm.
EAs are based on natural evolution concepts such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, selection on possible Solution.

The talk will cover:
- Evolutionary Algorithms basics
- Small Neural network as example
- Neuroevolution examples
